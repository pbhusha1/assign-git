•What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?•
gitignore file contains ignore rules. It specifically contains rules that are meant to be shared through the repository, so it should be included. 
(If you have ignore rules that you don't mean to share through the repository, 
there are other files where those would be defined; see the git ignore docs.)

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead the one you have checked-out. 

•Why should you have different branches?•
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.


In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
innumerable but origin shud be same.
